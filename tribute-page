    <div id="tribute-info">
    McCollum has been interested in trains from an early age, frequently riding the New York City Subway for days at a time. His fixation with trains has led McCollum to frequently impersonate MTA employees or a related entity, for which he has been jailed numerous times. McCollum has been rejected for employment by MTA on numerous occasions, although he is reported to know more about the trains, schedules, procedures and rail operations than any current employee.

A prison psychiatrist who did an evaluation diagnosed him with Asperger syndrome. McCollum is said to have memorized the New York City Subway map by age 8.
